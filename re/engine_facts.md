# Engine facts and research results

Moved verbatim out of CLAUDE.md on 2026-10-23 to keep the always-loaded brief small.

## Engine facts (Glacier 1, same family as Hitman: Blood Money)
- Class type IDs are identical in both exes; bit 0x100000 = group class. Registry pattern in
  `tools/kl_port_check.py` (`exe_classes`).
- Level = `Scenes/Locations/<L>/<L>_Main.zip` holding .gms .prp .TEX .prm .MAT .fxc .buf .oct .HVK
  .ANM .sgd .rmi .rmc .sgp .hrd .zgf .sup .LOC .SND (+ .WHD/.WAV beside the zip).
  The exe hardcodes `Locations/Fxx/Fxx_Main.zip`, so a converted map replaces a slot (F01 = Subway).
- `.prp` (IOPacked v0.1) token stream: see `tools/kl_prp.py` docstring. Nodes = [ROOT] + .gms
  entity table order (1:1). Classes come from .gms.
  - Count-prefixed reference lists: `04 n` + n×`0c` (no array markers). `04 n` + `0d` raw of n bytes.
  - Some arrays have a fixed length the reader asserts on (e.g. 200).
  - Enum value tables are in kl2.exe as {value, name*, next*} triples → `tools/dd_enums.json`.
- `.gms`: entity table, record +0x14 type id, cluster/pool table (rebuilt by `kl_gms.rebuild_clusters`),
  +0x34 = the PF4 pathfinder's navigation mesh (NOT sound occlusion; converted by `tools/kl_pf4.py`),
  +0x38 = -1, header[15] = REF slot count.
- DD item enum (InventoryBinding): each item may be bound once per level (except NoItem) — dup = assert.
- Rooms: DD's post-load room fix-up (kl2 0x48e910, called from loader 0x8adf48) resolves 0x74-byte
  portal records. DM rooms crash it; currently DM ZROOM/ZIngameMapGroup are retyped to ZGROUP.

## Known kl2.exe sites
- 0x64a856 prp reader token-type assert (expected vs read opcode) — reader object in esi,
  stream at reader+0xb4: [vtbl][?][?][pos][size] + 16 KB inline buffer (`debug/buf.py`).
- 0x8424a0 fixed array length assert (expected count pushed by caller, e.g. 0xc8).
- 0x7f779e duplicate slot registration (InventoryBinding by item enum value).
- 0x8ad7c0 entity loader: 128-byte slots from pool[category + 8*prio] of the parent group's block.
- 0x7fef36 (also 0x466942) memcpy of the level's .LOC into a STATIC buffer at 0xe100b8, no size check. The next global
  is 0xea2878 (600,000 bytes on, 68 code refs), so the cap is 600,000 bytes. Past it, the job-slot count at 0xeac170
  (639,160 bytes on) gets text, and 0x926b40 (kl2+0x526b40) faults later (TEST 1023e V1_DM01: 639,672-byte English .LOC,
  crash 77 s in). Stock English is about 457 KB; stock Russian is 612,634 bytes (open: not loaded through here, or Russian
  would crash). `kl_dmvoice.LOC_CAP`, `debug/check.py` print and flag the size.
  Why a 612,634-byte file survives (dump KLHook_1.dmp of 03:05, debug/notes/2026-10-23-scheduled-triage.md): a capstone
  sweep of all of .text finds, between 0xea2878 and 0xea6888, only 0xea2878 (the level's surface-table pointer,
  kl2 0x788cc0, freed at 0x41c360) and the stack-switch scratch 0xea2880/84/88 (written on use by 0x66ac50 / 0x926780);
  nothing addresses 0xea288c..0xea6887. In the dump [0xea2878] holds a heap pointer INSIDE the copied text, so the
  pointer is set AFTER the .LOC memcpy: the Russian spill (12,634 bytes, up to 0xea59d2) is overwritten again before
  it is read. So 600,000 is the block, 612,634 .. 616,400 (0xea6888) is a grey band the stock game lives in, and the
  first live state a bigger file hits is the stack-switch slots 0xea6888..0xea6894, then the handle allocator
  (free stack of words 0xea68d6, records 0xea70d8, counters 0xeac158..0xeac174 - 0xeac170 is the count 0x926b20 pops).

## Exact schemas (2026-10-08, method from HHCHunter/hbm-editor's RTP recovery)
- `tools/kl_exe.py` (PE by address, RTTI, exports) + `tools/kl_rtp.py`: every class's serialized
  field list straight from the exe. GetProperties = vtable slot 11 -> ZPropertyInfo chain (base
  first); a record is {next, name, filter, type handler}; filter bit 0 = stored in level files.
  Controllers resolve through the exported `?<Owner>_<Name>_ClassInfo@@3VZROUTCLASSINFO@@A`
  globals -> factory entry -> Create -> the vtable it stamps. The owner class is NOT enforced.
- `python tools/kl_rtp.py` rebuilds `re/kaneandlynch.json` and `re/kl2.json` (needs capstone) and
  proves them: every node and controller of every stock level must fit its class. Currently
  DM 338,983 + 47,238 and DD 520,438 + 121,289 objects, 0 misfits, 316 / 405 controllers resolved.
  Only `PhysicsTest` is used by levels but registered by neither exe (the engine skips it).
- `tools/kl_convert.py` is schema-driven only (no statistical fallback): fields are paired per
  class level by type + enum; Dog Days-only fields take Dog Days' most common value.
- The exes hold no property names. Where a level gained a field next to same-typed ones the
  pairing is an ASSUMPTION; the converter prints those levels ("assumed"). Worst: ZParticleEmitter,
  ZOnlineFragileAllianceSettings (188 -> 340 strings), ZFFActor, ZItemTemplateWeapon.
- Dog Days' exe still has every Dead Men geometry class except ZIngameMapGroup (so ZROOM, ZPlant,
  ZHavokCar, ZSHADOWMESHOBJ ... have exact layouts); kl_gms.RETYPE still flattens them, pending
  pool categories and room/portal data.
- Outputs and build inputs live in the work folder (`kl_port_check.workdir()` = `<DM>\KL_PortTools`).

## Research results (2026-10-08, agents' full reports: `<DM>\KL_PortTools\research\*.json`)
Verified on real files unless marked. Crash risks first.
- `.oct`: 16-byte header, then FIVE trees per ZROOM-derived entity in scene order (root first),
  then collision records up to -1, then a tail. A room retyped to a group must lose its trees
  (`tools/kl_oct.py`). The records after the trees are the same format in both games.
- `.rmi`/`.rmc` (room index): boxes name rooms by REF id; 0x54 bytes in Dead Men, 0x58 in Dog Days
  (`tools/kl_rooms.py`). REF ids follow the cluster table, so it must come out as Dead Men had it,
  and the entity must still be a room (crash at kl2 0x719884 otherwise).
- Navigation mesh: block at gms +0x34 -> PF4::ZData at database+0xc (kl2 0x538bc0). Without it the
  cover list crashes at 0x5503da (73 %). 16-bit -> 32-bit widening in `tools/kl_pf4.py`; most field
  pairings there are ASSUMED; M03 has an array-7 record with no known Dog Days form (refused).
- `.sgp` goes to the SOUND system (kl2 0x718180), not the pathfinder. Copied unchanged, unchecked.
- Rooms: gate (portal) records live in the `.buf`, addressed by two ZROOM properties. A record is
  0x38 bytes in Dead Men, 0x74 in Dog Days (walked by kl2 0x48e910): that stride mismatch is the
  old room fix-up crash. The extra 0x3c bytes (centre, half extents, 3x3 frame) are computable from
  the four corners. Convert the gate table and rooms can stay ZROOM.
- `.ANM` must not be copied: per-clip header is 0x50 bytes in Dead Men, 0x68 in Dog Days.
- `.prm`: `kl_prm.find_descriptors` misses descriptors with baked lighting (1375 in M02, 2250 in
  M03; none in M01/M06) - walk the model graph instead and clear drawMode bit 0x01000000. Dog Days
  descriptor dword 5 = Dead Men dword 2 (kl_prm writes 0). Scatter objects (lType 9) are 256 bytes
  in Dead Men, 144 in Dog Days, unrelated content (M01 has 4, M06 145).
- `.MAT`: Dead Men class definitions name techniques no Dog Days effect has; entry +0x18 surface
  type, +0x08 bit 0x10 (bump) and +0x0C render group are numbered differently.
- `.sgd`: strip section HavokShatterGlassConnectivity (M02/M03); M06 lacks ExplodableOctree.
- `.buf` tail (gms header +0x30): surface-material / impact table, Dead Men's shape. Unverified risk.
- `.LOC`: same format, but Dead Men's has 766 of the 5798 strings the Dog Days slot expects and
  its sound ids index the Dead Men .SND. Use the slot's own .LOC as base.
- Pool category is exact: `kl_gms.category()` (kl2 0x829b10). Unknown controller names are skipped
  cleanly by the engine (0x4f9800); an unregistered type id crashes at 0x46fe87 / 0x8add12; an
  empty pool at 0x8adbba. 0xa8e3cb (write to 0) is Steam's anti-debug probe, not a crash.
- Scene property block is read by name: the "32 -> 33 entries" item is NOT a load requirement.
- Boot (static reading, NOT yet tried live): kl2.exe reads no ini, but takes `-o <Key=Value>` on the
  command line (Steam launch options), e.g. `-o DefaultScene=Locations/F01/F01_Main.gms
  -o AutoExit=120 -o DisableSplashScreens`. Also MPMap, DisableAudio. This could make load tests
  click-free. No console, no assert text exists in retail (asserts are bare int3).
- Patch01.zip is mounted first and overrides same-named members of every archive; the FA level list
  is hard-coded (9 slots) but a slot string could be rewritten by KLHook, or MPMap used.
- Input is DirectInput8 only; scripted input is best injected inside the dinput8 proxy (KLHook).
- Crash triage: `python debug/triage.py --keep`; pre-flight a build with `python debug/check.py`.

## Research results, third set (2026-10-09; specs in `re/`, reports in the work folder's `research/track_*.json`)
Static reading and file statistics unless marked; none of it was tried in the running game.
- `re/havok.md` + `tools/kl_hvk.py`: .HVK is the same layout in both games (Havok 4.6.1 in both);
  placements carry REF labels; static shapes are grouped 510 per list shape, one MOPP code each.
  `kl_hvk.join(maps, systems)` joins files given {old REF: new REF} maps. All 21 stock files
  round-trip byte-identical. A map cannot be moved in world space (MOPP codes are world-space).
- `tools/kl_members.py`: .sgd (explodable octree, glass), .sgp (room sound graph), .hrd, .sup,
  .zgf, the surface table and the FDX block: read, write, join (self-test on 41 levels).
  Dead Men surface ids 25..31 are past Dog Days' table: `MATERIAL_ALIAS` (chosen by meaning).
- `re/pairings.md`: 20 classes' field pairings worked out from values and code, now in
  `kl_convert.LEVEL_MAPS` (assumed list 46 -> 26 classes; verify_levels still `problems: 0`).
- `re/characters.md`: a character is one object (`Heroes!Hero_0N\Ground`, ZFFPlayer / ZFFActor);
  the look is all in its .prm model. ZLNKOBJ / ZLNKWHANDS integers are offsets into the level's
  .SND: a Dead Men value must be re-pointed or zeroed, never copied.
- `re/menus.md`: menus are XML (`menu/frontend.xml` in Patch01.zip); a heister picker is XML plus
  one KLHook patch at 0x835837 (the random hero index 0..7). Nine entries per level toggler: hard.
- `re/netcode.md`: Steam lobbies + P2P; peers address objects by 16-bit scene references and no
  level hash check was found, so every player needs the identical build of a grafted map.
  Update intervals / tolerances are globals KLHook could tune (0xd35420.., after 0x4825b0 ran).

## Roadmap for a rewrite (only after the port works)
Ghidra project of kl2.exe + kaneandlynch.exe, shared symbol/type database (classes, vtables,
property schemas dumped at runtime by KLHook), then an owned-asset engine reading original files
(hl2-rs model). Never redistribute game code or data.
