# Graft direction and format modules

Moved verbatim out of CLAUDE.md on 2026-10-23 to keep the always-loaded brief small.

## Direction (owner, 2026-10-08): graft, not whole-level conversion
A compiled level holds the map AND the game systems (HUD, menus, cameras, weapons, players,
effects). Converting all of Dead Men's makes Dog Days' code run Dead Men's HUD / weapons / players:
every crash from 73 % on was one of those (last: ZOnScreenDisplay2 expects 200 fixed widgets, Dead
Men's HUD has 107). The owner wants: Dead Men MAPS, voice lines and player models; Dog Days guns
and sounds reused; delivered like DLC (own folder, not overwriting a stock map).

Top-level subtrees (objects / with models):
- Dead Men M01_FA_A: `Locations/` 3894/2707 = the map; `CloneGroup_Locations` 205; gameplay markers
  (SpawnPoint!, Triggers!, LevelBounds!, NoCover!, Player_Cover!, DropMoney!, Escape!, Settings!,
  EscCameraSetup!, CivilFleePoints!) ~420; AI_Enemies! / Civilians! / CivilianCars! ~290; Heroes! 32;
  systems to DROP: `gamemenu.zip` 1154, `AllLevels/mainsceneincludes.zip` 915, CloneGroup_Effects 3730.
- Stock Dog Days F01: systems to KEEP: `AllLevels/mainsceneincludes_multiplayer.zip` 3417,
  CloneGroup_Effects 5087, Heroes! 32; its map (`Locations/` 5749, Gameplay! 774, Animation/ escape
  vehicles 549, FASpecials!, Specials!) is what the Dead Men map replaces.
- Cross-references to renumber when joining two levels: .gms record +0x0c = chunk index in the
  .prm; texture ids (both games pack them from 128 up, ~1270 each, Dog Days allows 4096); material
  ids; .buf offsets (names, raw data, gates, lists); REF ids (follow the cluster table; stored in
  .oct trees, .rmi/.rmc, gates, lists); .oct collision records are referenced from .prm chunks.

## Format modules for the graft (2026-10-09; each round-trips every stock level of both games byte for byte)
- `tools/kl_scene.py` (.gms + .buf): `Scene` with an entity tree; `write()` regenerates every table;
  `remove(top)`, `graft(src, top)`. Full layout in its docstring. Header +0x1c is a heap budget (a
  number), the entity table's second dword is the entity's position in the list pool, the list pool
  links lights to geometry by slot, the dynamic list pre-sizes heaps for run-time objects.
- `tools/kl_prmgraph.py` (.prm): chunk kinds found by walking from the roots (.gms record +0x0c and
  several .prp fields), `closure`, `extract`, `append` with material / texture / .oct maps.
- `tools/kl_texmat.py` (.TEX .MAT .fxc): `merge_tex`, `merge_mat`, `merge_fxc`; limits 4096 texture
  ids, 2048 materials, 32 material classes.
- `tools/kl_octree.py` (.oct .rmi .rmc): parse/pack, `build_tree` (walks identically to the stock
  trees under a simulation of kl2 0x719850), `remap_ids`, `join_room_trees`, `append_records`.
TWO ID SPACES - do not mix them (tested directly on six levels, `.wf/idspace2.py`):
- SLOT id = loader slot index + 2. It follows the cluster table and scene order, so it CHANGES
  whenever entities are added, removed or change pool. Used by .oct room trees, .rmi and .rmc
  (100 % of ids resolve to rooms this way, 0 % as REF labels), and inside the .gms by the list
  pool and the room pairs (as slot * 0x80, Dead Men 0x70).
- REF label = record +0x30, free and stable. Used by room gates and neighbour lists in the .buf
  and by the surface table.
  (kl_scene's own notes say .oct/.rmi/.rmc use REF labels: that part is wrong.)
Not decoded: record +0x28 aux, what the heap budget counts, most of the .buf head, which
entities are listed in room trees (copy membership from the source level).
