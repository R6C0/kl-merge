# Owner's end goal and Retomoto design (full text)

Moved verbatim out of CLAUDE.md on 2026-10-23 to keep the always-loaded brief small.

## Owner's end goal (2026-10-09)
An EXPANSION: Dog Days keeps everything it has and gains all of Dead Men's content. Additive, never
replacement - testing in the F01 slot is temporary. In order:
1. Dead Men maps playable in Fragile Alliance / Arcade (graft), each in its own folder.
2. Dead Men voice lines and player models; Dog Days guns and sounds are reused.
3. Character / heister select, with each character usable once per match.
4. Online, once the above is solid. Then: choose your police character for after you die.
5. Much later: assets from Payday 2.
Do not start a later stage before the owner says the earlier one works.
Owner's wish list for stage 1: Retomoto Tower as a Fragile Alliance map, with its music. Dead Men
never shipped an FA version (the DLC maps are not on PC), so it has to be made from the campaign
level: M09_A (11,926 entities: tower offices and roof) and M09_B (16,646: lobby, elevators,
'Retomoto_Squad'). Music: 15 clips under Music/InHouse/Japan plus LevelSetup/Level/M09_A in
PC_Def.str. The graft supplies the map; the FA layer (spawn points, loot, escape, AI squads,
level bounds) does not exist for it and must be authored. After M01 plays.
The owner wants BOTH parts in ONE Fragile Alliance map (2026-10-09). That is a three-source graft
(Dog Days systems + M09_A map + M09_B map). Size is not the obstacle: the largest stock Dog Days
level (L10) has 42,915 entities; A + B have 28,572 before their own menus/HUD/effects are dropped,
and 1086 + 1332 textures against a 4096 limit (many shared). Open: how the two parts sit relative
to each other in world space (they are separate levels in the campaign), and the join between them.
Owner's design for it (2026-10-09), to be followed as given:
- Start: the heisters are ALREADY rappelled down at the main window, with the explosion sound
  playing as the round begins (the way stock Subway opens in the middle of the job). No rappel
  sequence. Straight into action as the main window blows.
- Part 1 (tower): fight through; loot comes from the STATUES, and from the MAIN ROOM once everyone
  in it is dead.
- Part 2 (lobby/street): out through the front entrance, down the road to a VAN, and escape.
  Mood reference: the street shoot-out in the film Heat.
- I am to design how the two parts join. Its level music plays.
- OWNER, 2026-10-09 22:00, after playing the wardrobe build: guards good, blast and shake 'amazing',
  police show up, the armour shows. LOOT PROPS: briefcases (not bags) in the start room; the stacks
  on the left side from spawn cannot be picked up - move them closer to the outer ring; the statue
  loot gets a fitting prop instead of a bag (agent y-loot). Execute not tried yet.
- OWNER, 2026-10-09 18:40, after playing the balcony start: the blast must be more VOLATILE,
  'like the subway one in the original game when u start in': it does the explosion but there is
  no smoke and no camera shake. Wanted: smoke / dust, debris, shake (agent t-blast).
- OWNER, 2026-10-09 17:00, after SEEING the tower in the game (supersedes the start options A / C
  and the spawn row inside the boardroom): the heisters start OUTSIDE, on the ledge just before
  the glass of the main window, and THEN the blow-up sequence happens and they go in.
  To build: a standing surface outside the window (x > 5850, boardroom floor y ~20996; in the
  campaign the players hang there on ropes - whether any walkable geometry / collision exists
  there is NOT known: check, else author an invisible ledge), the intact glass keeping them out
  until the blast, START row outside facing -x into the room, guards unaware until the blast,
  a kill / bounds answer for stepping off the ledge.
